# Asrock-B660M-PG-Riptide-modded-bios---ES-Chip-support-
Modded bios for the B660M Riptide to support intel 12th ES chips. 

### How to use: 
1. Download the version you want to flash to your board
2. Go tho the bios and Use Instant flash
3. DONE, your board should now support ES chips (tested on QYGC) !

### Modifications made: 
What was made to the bios is the removal of the last microcode (0670) and added the ES supported microcode (0674) 
Using MMTools, export the 0674 microcode (or the 0670 that can support some ES like QXQ3) from older ASUS or MSI B660M bios, remove one microcode and add the one you want ot add support.
